# init.vim

# DEPRECATED, use [paperbenni/init.lua](https://github.com/paperbenni/init.lua) instead

This is my neovim init.vim file

## install

```sh
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paperbenni/init.vim/main/install.sh)
```

**This setup requires neovim nightly. You may have to compile from source if there are no current build servers for your OS**
